 # How to Get Started?
 
 > - Clone My repo using git clone "repo url"<br>
 > - Install the Jdk 18 and configure it properly<br>
 > - cd inside the repo and in any terminal type "java server.java"  to run the server app directly<br>
 > - Open the second terminal in the same directory and type "java client.java" command to open the two instances of the application.<br>
 > - If you get any error make sure java installed correctly and its path is properly configured in system environment variable.<br>
 > - First Select Host in one app and then client in other app.<br>
 > - Ip is by default local host. No need to change it if you are testing this application. Note- (Client needs to type the ip of the host)<br>
 > - If trying on two different machine then client needs to type that machine Ip Address. Note- (I have not tried this app in two different machines)<br>
 > - When it shows connected, just type your messages and send it using the send button.
 
 # Other Info
 > - The Gui of this application is designed in Netbeans IDE 18 gui builder from scratch.
 > - The internal components functionality is are written by Me <i>(Mithilesh Yadav)</i>
